Trend Analysis code:

    This code offers an in-depth analysis of the S&P 500 index using its historical closing prices. 
    It employs a multifaceted approach to financial market analysis, encompassing several key areas:

    Trend Analysis: Utilizes simple and exponential moving averages (SMAs and EMAs) to identify market trends, 
    including identifying zones of bullish and bearish behavior and key crossover points like golden and death crosses.
    
    Statistical Measures: Conducts statistical analysis on moving averages, including calculating periods above and below 
    these averages and their respective percentage changes.
    
    Volatility Analysis: Examines the volatility of the market by calculating the Z-score of daily returns, 
    identifying extreme movements, and analyzing rolling volatility. 
    This section includes sensitivity analysis using various Z-score thresholds 
    to understand the frequency and intensity of market movements.
    
    Comparative Analysis: Extends the analysis to compare the S&P 500's behavior with other financial assets 
    like the US Dollar Index, Gold, Silver, and Bitcoin, focusing on their rolling volatilities.
    
    Technical Analysis: Applies technical analysis indicators such as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) 
    and the Relative Strength Index (RSI).
    It generates buy and sell signals based on these indicators and calculates associated statistics, 
    such as average gains and losses.
    
    Duration Analysis: Calculates the duration and performance of bullish and bearish periods as indicated by RSI and MACD
    signals, providing insights into the effectiveness of these periods in terms of average gains and losses.
    
This comprehensive toolset provides a detailed perspective on the S&P 500's behavior, useful for traders, analysts, and anyone interested in understanding market dynamics. The code not only identifies key trends and movements in the stock market but also offers statistical insights and comparative analysis, making it a valuable resource for in-depth financial market analysis.
